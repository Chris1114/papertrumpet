Founder             of Texas based band Drama Tiki (1992-1998) who independently released             three albums and were voted Best Folk/Acoustic Group 1998 by the Fort             Worth Weekly, Dyer now appears in the flesh with acoustic and song             in Chapel Hill, NC and surrounding areas. Dyer was recently honored             as a finalist in the NCSC Songwriters contest 2000 and has just released             his debut solo album One Among, a mosaic of spirited melody, cathartic             rhythm, and playful and explosive vocalizations. Experience Dyer's             character, drive, and vision directly, nerves exposed, bares bones,             truly, intimately.</font></b></font></p>          <p>&nbsp;</p>          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#FFFFCC" size="2"><b>Click             the press photo above to download a high-res (300 dpi) printable version.</b></font></p>        </div>      </td>    </tr>  </table></div><div align="center">  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-2">copyright &copy;2000 JTD</font></p></div></body></html>
